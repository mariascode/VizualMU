VizualMU MockUp for a Data Communication Company

Mock-up Landing Page for an Webservice with subscibtion plans. The page is kept in mainly two lively colors that make a dynamic loom without being too busy.
It was developed mobile-first approach. Accessibility and an easily flowing UX without unnecessary distractions make sure that every user stays focused on the product.

The page is composed of HTML & CSS.

This project is my own and not based on a tutorial.
